## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Core NLP techniques that power language understanding, information extraction, and contextual reasoning:

- **NER (Named Entity Recognition)**  
  Identifies entities like people, organizations, and locations in unstructured text.

- **LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)**  
  An unsupervised method for discovering latent topic structures in large text collections.

- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**  
  A type of RNN effective for modeling time-series and sequential language data.

- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**  
  A transformer-based model from Google that enables deep contextual understanding of language, widely used in classification and QA.

- **Transformer Architecture**  
  A scalable attention-based model that underpins all modern LLMs, allowing efficient parallel processing of long sequences.

## Large Language Models (LLMs)

### 1). Major Model Providers

- **OpenAI** – GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini  
- **Meta (LLaMA 3)** – Open-source LLMs designed for flexibility and performance  
- **Google (Gemini Pro)** – Multimodal LLMs with advanced reasoning capabilities  
- **DeepSeek R1** – Cost-effective and lightweight Chinese LLM  
- **Others** – Claude (Anthropic), Mistral, etc.

### 2).  Prompt Engineering 

Prompt engineering focuses on designing effective inputs to guide LLM behavior and improve output quality.

#### (a). Types of Prompts:
- **System Prompts** – Define overarching behavior and rules for the LLM  
- **User Prompts** – Provide task-specific input or questions for the model

#### (b). Key Techniques:
- **Zero-shot / One-shot / Few-shot Prompting** – Adjusting examples to shape model behavior  
- **Role-based Prompting** – Assigning personas or instructions to influence style and tone  
- **Instruction Tuning** – Optimizing prompts for specific tasks or use cases  

Prompt engineering is critical for enhancing tasks such as classification, summarization, question answering, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

### 3). Model Optimization & Knowledge Retrieval

#### (a). Fine-Tuning

Adapts general-purpose models for specialized domains using labeled data.

- **PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)**  
  Tunes only a small subset of parameters, reducing memory and compute requirements.

- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**  
  Introduces trainable low-rank matrices into pre-trained weights, enabling efficient domain adaptation with minimal overhead.

#### (b). Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG enhances LLM output by injecting context from external knowledge sources.

**RAG Workflow:**
1. **Data Extraction** – Parse and chunk content from PDFs, web pages, SQL databases, etc.  
2. **Embedding** – Convert chunks to vector representations using embedding models  
3. **Vector Search** – Retrieve semantically relevant content from a vector database  
4. **Prompt Augmentation** – Enrich LLM prompts with retrieved information

**Popular Vector Databases:**
- `FAISS`  
- `Chroma`  
- `Pinecone`
