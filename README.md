## ü§ñ Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Essential NLP techniques that power language understanding, analysis, and generation:

- **NER (Named Entity Recognition)**  
  Identifies and classifies entities such as people, organizations, locations, etc., within unstructured text.

- **LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)**  
  An unsupervised algorithm used for discovering latent topic structures within large collections of documents.

- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**  
  A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) adept at learning long-term dependencies in sequential data.

- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**  
  A pre-trained transformer model by Google that enables deep contextual understanding; widely used for classification, question answering, and embedding tasks.

- **Transformer Architecture**  
  A scalable, parallelizable attention-based model architecture that underpins all modern LLMs.

## ü§ñ Large Language Models (LLMs)

### 1. Leading Model Providers

- **OpenAI**: GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini  
- **Meta (LLaMA 3)**: Open-source model family tailored for research and deployment  
- **Google (Gemini Pro)**: Multimodal LLM series with advanced reasoning capabilities  
- **DeepSeek R1**: Lightweight, high-efficiency Chinese LLM  
- **Others**: Claude (Anthropic), Mistral, etc.

### 2. Development Frameworks & Tools

- **LangChain**  
  A flexible framework for building LLM-powered applications that supports memory, agents, chaining, and tool integrations.

- **Vector Databases**  
  Enable high-speed semantic retrieval of embedded content to enhance LLM responses.  
  Common vector stores include:
  - `FAISS`
  - `Chroma`
  - `Pinecone`

### 3. Model Optimization & Retrieval Techniques

#### üîß Fine-Tuning
Tailors pre-trained models for domain-specific use cases using custom datasets.

Popular techniques include:

- **PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)**  
  A set of methods that fine-tune only a small subset of model parameters, significantly reducing training cost and memory usage while preserving performance.

- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**  
  A PEFT method that injects trainable low-rank matrices into existing weights, allowing efficient adaptation of large models without modifying the original parameters.

#### üîÑ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Combines LLMs with external sources to enhance factual accuracy and context:

- Extracts and chunks information from structured/unstructured data (e.g., PDFs, web pages, SQL tables)  
- Stores embeddings in vector databases for fast semantic similarity search  
- Incorporates dynamic prompts and chaining logic for multi-turn, context-aware dialogue
